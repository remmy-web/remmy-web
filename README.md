## 👋 Hi there! I'm Yiga Remegious

🎓 I'm an agriculturalist (soil scientist by training), and tech is my hobby.  
💡 I enjoy tackling challenging concepts because they force me to think critically and come up with creative solutions.  
🛠️ I love tech because it allows me to build new things from scratch and solve real-world problems.

📚 I work with Django, React, and machine learning.  
🎯 I'm currently building a soil analysis API to support labs across Africa.  
🚀 Always exploring innovative ways to help farmers embrace tech and thrive better.
